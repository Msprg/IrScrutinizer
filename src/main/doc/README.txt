IrScrutinizer is a powerful program for capturing, generating,
analyzing, importing, and exporting of infrared (IR) signals. For
capturing and sending IR signals several different hardware sensors
and senders are supported. IR Signals can be imported not only by
capturing from one of the supported hardware sensors (among others:
IrWidget, Global Caché, and Arduino), but also from a number of
different file formats (among others: LIRC, Wave, Pronto Classic and
professional, RMDU (partially), and different text based formats; not
only from files, but also from the clipboard, from URLs, and from file
hierarchies), as well as the Internet IR Databases by Global Caché and
by IRDB. Imported signals can be decoded, analyzed, edited, and
plotted. A collection of IR signal can thus be assembled and edited,
and finally exported in one of the many supported formats.  In
addition, the program contains the powerful IrpTransmogrifier IR-renderer,
which means that almost all IR protocols known to the Internet
community can be generated.

Written in Java (with the exception of one (on Linux two) native libraries),
most of the functionality of the program is available on every Java platform.
The native library (nrjavaserial, successor of RXTX) is presently available for
32- and 64-bit versions of Windows, Linux (x86, amd-64, and arm), and
MacOsX, and can with moderate effort be compiled for other platforms.
