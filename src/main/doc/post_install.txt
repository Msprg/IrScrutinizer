IrScrutinizer can now be started by selecting it from the start menu,
or by double clicking the icon.

Provided the option "Add installation directory to path" has been selected,
the command line programs IrpTransmogrifier and HarcHardware can be started
from a so-called DOS-box using the command name "irptransmogrifier" and
"harchardware" respectively. (Otherwise the full path name can be used.)

Documentation is available through the Help menu.
